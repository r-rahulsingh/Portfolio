# Data Science

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
|[Osteoarthritis Classification](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/KneeOAclassification) | December 2024 | Python, CNN, UNet, ML, DL| Osteoarthritis (OA) impacts older adults, and assessing knee OA severity is critical for timely treatment. This study proposes an automated pipeline using femur-tibia bone distance measurements as indirect cartilage biomarkers, derived from MRI bone masks. A custom algorithm enhanced segmentation, identified bone contours, and computed gap-region distances to create patient-specific feature vectors. The approach improves classification accuracy, offering a scalable and objective solution for OA severity assessment.|
|[HSV Image Retrieval](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/SimpleImageRetrieval) | November 2024 | Python, MATLAB, OpenCV, HSV color space, NumPy, Matplotlib, Histogram Computation, Jupyter Notebook | This project builds a simple content-based image retrieval system using 256-bin HSV histograms. A custom function computes histograms for Hue, Saturation, and Value. Images in a database are analyzed, and histograms are visualized. The retrieval system ranks database images based on histogram intersection similarity with the query image. Results include ranked images and their similarity scores.|
|[Brain Tumor Detection](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/Brain_Tumor_Detection) | May 2024 | Python, Neural Networks, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib | A well-designed CNN can classify MRI images into ‘tumor’ or ‘no tumor’ categories with an accuracy surpassing that of current standard methods. The CNN’s diagnostic support will reduce the time needed for radiological evaluations without compromising, and possibly enhancing, diagnostic accuracy.|
|[NY Crime Analysis](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/NYPD_Crime_Incident_Analysis) | April 2024 | Python, seaborn, XGBoost, scikit-Learn, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GridSearchCV, LogisticRegression | Classifying shooting incidents in New York City involves analyzing features like occurrence date and time, borough, location, suspect and victim demographics, and geographical coordinates. This classification helps law enforcement identify patterns and factors associated with high-risk incidents, allowing them to prioritize response efforts and deploy preventive measures effectively.|
|[Multi purpose chatbot via FlanT5](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/Prompt_Engineering_FlanT5) | Feb 2024 | Python, LLM, Huggingface Transformers, Zero Shot, One Shot, Few Shots, Tuning Inference using Generative Configuration | Three tasks were completed: medical chatbot information retrieval, self-conversation chat information retrieval, and conversation information retrieval for customer interactions.|
|[Traffic Collisions Automatic Reporting](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/Traffic-Collisions_ACRS) | Jan 2024 | Python, EDA, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Accuracy Score, Classification Report, Regularization, Parameter Tuning, Fine Tuning | Developed a project for automatic traffic collision reporting, utilizing a dataset detailing motor vehicle operators involved in collisions on Montgomery County roadways. The dataset includes preliminary reports from multiple police departments, with potential unverified data or classification changes based on further investigations.|
|[Mental Health Analysis](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/Mental_Health_Analysis) | November 2023 | Python, EDA, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQL, Data Extraction | The project explores mental health data using Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Through visualizations, it highlights the prevalence of mental health issues and gender disparities, revealing key factors influencing well-being. The analysis uncovers patterns and provides insights for targeted, personalized interventions to improve mental health.|
|[Loan-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/r-rahulsingh/Loan-Data-Analysis) | October 2023 | Python, EDA, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQL, Data Extraction | This study analyzes loan data to improve the performance of financial institutions' loan portfolios. By applying advanced data analytics, it identifies patterns, risks, and opportunities, offering insights for better risk management, personalized lending, and increased profitability. The research supports evidence-based decision-making, helping financial professionals adapt to evolving markets.|
